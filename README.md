# contact-me
This is a document to read before contacting me.

## developers
This document is mainly meant for recruiters, who make up about 98% of the strangers contacting me. 
* If you want to contact me for advise on development you can feel free to do so. 
* If you like to use this document yourself you may. However I might update it so it would be wise to link to a specific version or fork it and make your own.
