# contact-me
This is a document to read before contacting me.

## developers
This document is mainly meant for recruiters, who make up about 98% of the strangers contacting me. 
* If you want to contact me for advise on development you can feel free to do so. 
* If you like to use this document yourself you may. However I might update it so it would be wise to link to a specific version or fork it and make your own.

## recruiters
If you're an IT recruiter interested in aquiring my services for a client (or if you are the client) this document is meant for you. It may come of a bit stern, but cold calls, emails and LinkedIn messages from recruitment companies have taken up an unacceptable amount of my time over the years. 

Therefore any attempt to contact me that doesn't comply to this list will be replied to with only a short polite request to comply to the list. It will save us both a lot of time in the long run, because the vast majority of offers I've had in the past turned out to be a mismatch. Something we could have known much faster if the important information had been communicated from the start.
